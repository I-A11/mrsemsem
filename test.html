    <h1>Hi GitHub</h1>
<p>
  Hello my friends, Today I am going to talk to you about birthday celebrations
  between the past and present.
</p>
The cake, the candles, the presents, and the song all changed over time to
create today’s celebration.
<p>
  In the old days, birthdays were only celebrated kings and queens. In the past,
  birthdays invitations were sent by mail or by home phones, while now
  invitations can be sent via emails, mobile phones calls or messages.
</p>

<p>
  In the past, birthdays were usually celebrated at homes but now With more busy
  working women, parties can be celebrated at home, mcdonalds or playgrounds.
  </p>
  <p>
      With industrial evolution , more coloured fabrics allowed the production of
  beautiful party decorations which were not available in the past. 
  </p>
  <p>
Birthday
  cakes in the past were simple and had one candle for each year. Nowadays cakes
  can be themed with fancy colourful icing.
  </p>
  <p>
Birthday photos in the past were
  black and white, nowadays photos are taken by mobile phones and are colored
  </p>
  <p>
      presents in the past were wooden toys or stuffed toys while nowadays there are
  battery and electric toys
  </p>
   <p>
The birthday song was wrote by school teachers wrote
  and was “Good Morning To All”, the song changed overtime and became the famous
  “happy birthday to you” song In the end,
   </p>
   <p>
birthday celebration may be different
  from time to time but at all times, birthday is a chance to family and friends
  to come together to celebrate, sing and eat delicious cakes.
